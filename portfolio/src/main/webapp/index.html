      <h1>Amina's Portfolio</h1>
      <p>This is my portfolio.</p>
      <p> I am a sophomore at Columbia University, studying Mathematics and Computer Science.</p>
      <p> I grew up in Bucharest, Romania where I competed in national and international Maths olympiads. </p>
      <p> Through them, I got to visit amazing places such as Florence, Kyiv and Amsterdam!</p>

      <p> Starting college, I realised I want to focus more on creating and developing products to enhance people's livelihoods and encourage development. That is why I decided I want to pursue a career in Computer Science and learn how to utilise technology to achieve my goals.</p>
      <p> Consequently, I joined Columbia's Daily Spectator, our university's newspaper organization, where in the spring semester I worked on the design of a housing webpage to provide essential information not provided by the university and guide students to make the best decision. Currently, we are working on turning the Spectator into a mobile app to make it more accessible and engaging for our readers and also be able to incorporate fun sections - such as Crosswords!</p>
      <p> Last but not least, this is my grumpy cat and partner in crime, Kit!</p>

      <p> Fun fact: I named him after Kit Harrington back when I was obsessed with Game of Thrones!</p>
